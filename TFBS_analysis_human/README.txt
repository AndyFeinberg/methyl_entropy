This fold contains the code for performing the analyses of NME and MML of transcription factor motif binding sites at regulatory DNA and non-regulatory DNA for human samples.

TFBS_human_regions.R: obtain regulatory and non-regulatory regions.
TFBS_human_process_data_NME.R: summarize NME data into the median values of all regulatory or non-regulatory motif sites for each motif in every sample.
TFBS_human_process_data_MML.R: summarize MML data into the median values of all regulatory or non-regulatory motif sites for each motif in every sample.
TFBS_human_figure_table_NME.R: generate heatmaps and perform differential analysis between regulatory and non-regulatory motif sites for NME.
TFBS_human_figure_table_MML.R: generate heatmaps and perform differential analysis between regulatory and non-regulatory motif sites for MML.
