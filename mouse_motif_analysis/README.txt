This fold contains the code for performing the differential motif enrichment analysis of genomic regions where UC is driven by NME and regions where UC is driven by MML in different mouse develemental tissues.

UC_motif_analysis_mouse_region.R: get NME only regions and MML only regions for each tissue and get control regions.
UC_motif_analysis_mouse_NME_only.R: motif enrichment analysis for NME only regions.
UC_motif_analysis_mouse_MML_only.R: motif enrichment analysis for MML only regions.
UC_motif_analysis_mouse_result_process.R: process the motif enrichment result and perform differential enrichment between NME only region and MML only regions.
UC_motif_analysis_mouse_figure.R: generate scatterplots.
